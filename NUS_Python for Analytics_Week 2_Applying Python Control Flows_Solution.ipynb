    "You may find that the \"Cheerleader\" program that we discussed is not yet perfect. One of the most significant flaws is that it gives wrong articles (a, an or the) for some of the letters. For example, the correct sentence should be \"Give me an I\", but the program would print \"Give me a I\". We, therefore, want to correct this mistake in the updated version of the \"Cheerleader\" program. Another change is to use uppercase when each letter is shouted out. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Write a program to incorporate these two changes in the \"Cheerleader\" program. A sample output is given below.\n",
    "    \n",
    "***Note: The usage of the articles 'a' or 'an' depends on how we pronounce a letter and not whether a letter is a vowel. In addition to the vowels A, E, I and O, other letters that have vowel sounds in pronunciation (such as F, H, L, M, N, R, S and X) also take the article 'an'. The letter U, although a vowel, is pronounced as 'yew' and hence takes the article 'a'.***"
